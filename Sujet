Hi Loic,




Mini-project: Weather Forecast Web

Create a Weather forecast web application which will display the current weather and a forecast for a place (city, village, coords)
 entered by the user.

Technologies to be used
Must use AngularJS (www.angularjs.org) & Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com/) for the web client.
Weather data will be provided by openweathermap.org using its JSON API (openweathermap.org/API).
Functionalities
Search by entering the city name, state and country, or geographic coordinates.
The results should include the current weather in metric or imperial system as a user's choice, as well as the forecast
 for up to 5 days ahead.
User can select the language of the results (default English).
Displayed information should include the appropriate images for the weather provided by www.openweathermap.org.
If users comes back to the app, the app remembers the last city selected.
Once done
Deploy your project on a public server
Upload your source code to www.github.com

Send us both links so we can go look at it. Please copy me, Daniel, and Ivaylo (all CCed here).
What is important
Everything should work
It should look good
The code should read like prose and there are enough comments
